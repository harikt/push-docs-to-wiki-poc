# push-docs-to-wiki

This is an example on how to push changes to the GitHub wiki pages. Docs are maintained in [./docs/wiki](https://github.com/xtreamwayz/push-docs-to-wiki-poc/tree/master/docs/wiki) and are pushed with [deploy.sh](https://github.com/xtreamwayz/push-docs-to-wiki-poc/blob/master/docs/deploy.sh) to the wiki git repo if changes are detected.

You can find more info in the [wiki](https://github.com/xtreamwayz/push-docs-to-wiki-poc/wiki) :)
